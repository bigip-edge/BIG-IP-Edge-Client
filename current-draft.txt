                    Self Assigned IPv6 Edge Subnets
               draft-hinden-6man-ipv6-edge-subnet-00.txt

Abstract

   This document present a simple strategy for setting up special
   purpose subnets in edge networks without requiring additional prefix
   assignments from the network service provider, and also without
   breaking the current practice of assigning a single /64 prefix to an
   edge network.

   TODO: explain what we actually propose.

1.  Introduction

   The current IPv6 address assignment strategy works very well for edge
   networks, as long as these networks include a single subnet.  But as
   soon as a network requires more than one subnet, we observe a tension
   between two possible solutions.

   The standard practice in home networks is to use the prefix
   delegation mechanism and obtain a network prefix from the network
   service provider.  An obvious solution for multiple subnets is to use
   the same prefix delegation mechanism to obtain additional prefixes,
   and assign them to the additional networks.  While this solution is
   technically sound, it requires cooperation from the network service
   provider.  There are fears that the network service provider might
   charge an additional fee for these additional network prefixes.
   These fears may or may not be grounded in facts, but in any case the
   network provider will need to expand more resource to manage several
   prefixes than to manage a single one.

   Another plausible solution is to allow edge devices to derive from
   the prefix allocated by the network service provider a set of longer
   prefixes, which could then be assigned to different subnets.  That
   solution may very well work, but it would requires all hosts to
   support address configuration with variable length subnet prefixes.
   A number of currently fielded devices do not have that capability.
   Their IPv6 stack assumes that the subnet prefix is 64 bit long.  A
   large fraction of these hosts will not be updated in the near future.

Internet-Draft              IPv6 Edge Subnets                August 2017


   If we ignore this issue and assume that all host will be updated to
   handle variable length subnets, there is a fear that some network
   providers will handle by default very long subnet prefixes, forcing
   complex edge networks to pay extra for shorter prefixes that could be
   subnetted.

   Yet another solution would be to use a form of local addressing
   combined with IPv6 to IPv6 NAT.  Each subnet in the home would get a
   /64 prefix using Unique Local Address (ULA), and some stateful NAT
   would do the translation to the IPS assigned prefix.  This solution
   is despised by many IPv6 experts, because it would import to IPv6 the
   various problems caused by NAT in IPv4.  However, in the absence of
   alternative, this solution relieves the price pressure linked to the
   acquisition of long prefixes or multiple prefixes.

   In this document, we propose an alternative to multiple prefixes or
   generalized support of variable length subnets.  We assume that the
   current practice of assigning a /64 prefix to a "customer" network
   will continue, and we assume that most hosts will continue directly
   connecting to this /64 subnet.  Special purpose networks, on the
   other hand, will "self assign" a subnet of that /64 prefix.  We do
   not expect that these networks will use SLAAC.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Problem Statement and Requirements

   Today, most home networks use a simple architecture consistent with
   the IEEE 802 series of standards.  Multiple segments may use
   different transport mechanisms such as 802.3 or 802.11, but these
   segments can be bridged according to 802.1.  In this architecture,
   the entire edge network appears to IPv6 hosts as a single subnet.
   Most IPv6 devices just work.

   There are scaling issues with this bridged network architecture,
   mostly caused by the N-square effects of multicast based
   transmission.  However, we expect that these scaling issues will be
   solved by adequate support of IPv6 in the bridges.  There are known
   examples of such networks scaling up to several ten thousands hosts,
   which is somewhat larger than the expected size of most home
   networks.

   There are however other issues than scaling that may require
   subnetting.  One potential issue is the need to isolate a fraction of

   the network for security reasons.  Another plausible issue is the
   deployment of special purpose subnets, such as CLAT.

2.1.  Segment isolation

   TODO.

2.2.  CLAT

   TODO.

3.  Self assigned subnet

   TODO: general idea, a box assigns itself a subnet.

   TODO: maybe a beautiful diagram with a /64 and two /96

3.1.  Defending a subnet claim with DAD

   TO DO: how to use DAD to claim a /80 or a /96.

   TO DO: probabilies of SLAAC collision with a self assigned subnet.
   Show that this is typically not very large.

3.2.  Routing considerations

   TODO: general solution using ND proxy.

   TODO: what about multicast.

   TODO: special case of same box colocation.  The home router also
   manages the special purpose network.  Example are dedicated Wi-Fi
   network with special password, or CLAT managed by edge router.

4.  CLAT using self assigned subnet

   TODO, if we really care.  Or maybe this is a different draft.

5.  Security Considerations

   Yeah, right.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any IANA action.
